### Move to SF
Still have to find an apartment. Went a month earlier than my move-in date and that was _still too early_.

### Keep up with Japanese
Took Japanese my last semester of college. Going to buy the textbook and hopefully spend an hour or two each day improving.

### Contribute to an open source project
Feel like this will be an important step in my career and give me some good experience developing with others.

### Strengthen data structure and algo foundation
I want to get into competitive programming or at least feel extremely comfortable with the inner workings of most data structures.

### Read up on personal finance
You'd think this topic would be a required course in college but nope. Have a lot to learn about budgeting, paying off my loans, stocks, etc.

### Find a swing dancing organization
Swing dancing was pretty fun this semester and I want to do it for like 3 weeks straight to get decently confident at it.

### Gym
LETS GOOOOOOO
