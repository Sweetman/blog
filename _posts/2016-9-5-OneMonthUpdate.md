Alright. Slacking after 1 blog post :')

Finally settled in. Apartment looks good, roommate is dope, work is going well. Still have a lot to learn and constantly thinking about how to improve myself. Here are my goals for right now.

## Current Goals

### Learn software design patterns
Current reading Head First Design Patterns to learn about this. Hope to finish by the end of September.

### Blow through HackerRank Data Structure and Algorithm Problems
Just a refresher/strengthener on the core concepts

### Fitness
Mobility stretching has become such a huge part of my routine this last month. I started doing more and my lifts have never felt better. Took a month off lifting to really work on mobility and my form. Tomorrow, I start PHAT again refocused and better than after.

### Japanese
Will probably sign up for Japanese course. I want to visit Japan in February/March and it would be cool to speak to the locals. Bought some workbooks to get on it and will probably be getting into a class soon.
